PRoXe is an <a href="https://github.com/scottkall/proxe" target="_blank">open-source</a> website designed to disseminate information relevant to patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and particularly PDXs from patients with leukemia or lymphoma. The repository was developed by the <a href="http://weinstock.dfci.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Weinstock Laboratory</a> and published in April, 2016 (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27070704" target="_blank">Townsend et al. Cancer Cell 2016</a>) . A subset of PDXs on PRoXe are available for distribution through the Center for Patient Derived Models (CPDM) established at <a href="www.dana-farber.org/" target="_blank">Dana-Farber Cancer Institute</a>.

**Limitations in line availability**

Some of the PDXs hosted on PRoXe can be distributed by the CPDM to academic and industry investigators. Limitations range from patient approval to contributing institution restrictions that prohibit Dana-Farber from distributing PDXs derived from outside patients.

We actively encourage outside institutions to adopt the open-source model and ask that you convey the importance of open access to your own institution. We can provide contact information for investigators at centers outside of Dana-Farber who may be able to facilitate access for some lines that are currently restricted.

**Line distribution**

The CPDM operates as a cost-neutral strategic center according to NCI rules and does not generate profit. As a result, prices may change over time inversely proportional to volume. We believe our current pricing will allow academic laboratories to acquire large numbers of PDXs within their disease(s) of interest.

After gaining access, investigators are free to review line- and disease-level data and can find links to download raw genomics data. Investigators can then request individual lines in multiple formats by completing a specimen request form. We ask for a brief description of the studies planned for these lines to track usage – this information will be included in the MTA. We do not select investigators, projects, areas of interest or other criteria for distribution. Available vials are provided on a first-come, first-served basis.

PDX lines are currently available in the following formats:

1. Single vial of viably frozen cells
2. Multiple vials of viably frozen cells – *Under most circumstances, we are currently unable to immediately provide multiple frozen vials of individual lines due to a lack of adequate frozen stocks. Providing multiple vials may require expansion within one or more mice, which we can perform to meet individual requests. Expansion in a single mouse can generate between 5-500 million cells depending on the line.*
3. Fresh cells obtained from one or more engrafted mice – *Fresh cells will require expansion within one or more mice.*

Once the request is received and approved, we will generate a Material Transfer Agreement (MTA) request from the <a href="www.dana-farber.org/Research/Technology-Transfer.aspx" target="_blank">Belfer Office of DFCI Innovation</a> that is forwarded to the Institutional Officer designated in your request. Because of the very large number of requests, the MTA is non-negotiable (like MTAs with Addgene or ATCC) and has specific restrictions:

1. Academic Research Laboratories – *like cell lines acquired from non-profit resources (e.g. ATCC or RIKEN), the individual laboratory that acquires the vial(s) and/or fresh cells has rights to expand, modify and bank. They DO NOT have rights to transfer these products or any derivatives generated from it to any other laboratory, academic institution or industrial partner. The line and/or fresh cells may be used for industry-sponsored research performed in direct collaboration with the purchasing laboratory the line within the purchasing laboratory or a designated core laboratory at that academic institution. In an effort to maximize the use of these lines, DFCI does not retain intellectual property on inventions made with these PDXs or their derivatives, but does not allow for distribution or transfer.*
2. Industry – *vials and fresh cells can be shipped to industry investigators for one time use only, either in vitro or in vivo. There are no rights to modify the lines, to bank cells after in vitro or in vivo passage, to expand the lines in any way or to transfer the lines to either academic or industry investigators. Industry investigators wishing to discuss more extensive in vivo studies or in-license of lines should [contact PRoXe](mailto:proxe.feedback@gmail.com?Subject=PRoXe%20corporate%20rates).*

For all other potential users (academic core laboratories, educators, etc.) please contact PRoXe to discuss any ideas or possible model sharing.

Once the MTA is approved by both institutions and billing information is confirmed, plans for shipping will be finalized by email between the requesting Investigator and CPDM personnel. Tracking information will be provided and billing will not occur until shipping. We will arrange for shipping through FedEx.

**Billing through iLab**

Upon your first PRoXe request you will receive an introductory "Welcome to the Center for Patient Derived Models"" email, which provides basic information about registering for our Core in iLab. The CPDM expands and distributes our PDX models in addition to other modeling services. Internal DFCI customers may already have an iLab account, in which case you don't need to register. Internal and external investigators without an iLab account will need to register, which only takes a few minutes. After registration you will receive a cost projection from the Core covering fees for PDX vials, shipping costs, and consulting costs (if applicable). At that time you will need to both confirm that you accept the projected cost and provide payment information. For internal customers please provide a DFCI-approved project cost center #. For external customers a PO # is preferred; if you must use a credit card please contact [Abigail Ossip](mailto:Abigail_Ossip@dfci.harvard.edu?Subject=PRoXe%20credit%20card%20use) and she will forward this request to accounting to process. Charges can be added or removed from a billing event up until final billing is processed. The initial communication is simply to collect payment information and agree upon an initial cost. You will not be charged until the Material Transfer Agreement is fully executed (if applicable) and the vials are shipped.

**Consulting**

We offer consulting in 30-minute increments to guide the selection and use of PDXs. A consulting appointment is required to address any question(s) that require more than 5 minutes to address by e-mail or that clearly require a telephone interaction. Although we would like to provide this service free-of-charge, doing so would compromise our sustainability. Please do not be offended if we require a formal, billed appointment. Similarly, if the consultation extends beyond the initial allotted appointment, please do not be offended that this will require additional charges. If you are interested in a consulting appointment, please [contact us](mailto:proxe.feedback@gmail.com?Subject=PRoXe%20consulting) so that we can better understand your specific needs and ensure that the correct expertise is available. Before a consultation can occur, billing information must be available (see *Billing through iLab*).

App web development. PRoXe is written mainly in the R programming language by Scott Kallgren (Twitter: @scottkall) and Sharla Gelfand (Twitter: @sharlagelfand). As an open-source project, its code and latest updates can be viewed in <a href="https://github.com/scottkall/proxe" target="_blank">Scott's GitHub repository</a>.

If you have ideas for ways to improve PRoXe, please tell us.
